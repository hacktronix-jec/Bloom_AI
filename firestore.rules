/**
 * @description This ruleset allows public read access to all collections, but restricts write access.
 *   Since there's no user authentication or ownership, all data is treated as public and any user can attempt to write data.
 *   However, since there are no ownership fields, all writes are denied to protect the data.
 * @dataStructure Top-level collections are used for `bloomEvents`, `predictionModels`, `satelliteData`, and `citizenReports`.
 * @keySecurityDecisions No user listing is explicitly denied as this functionality does not exist in the application.
 *   All write access is disabled by default due to the lack of user authentication and ownership.
 * @denormalization None is required as there is no user-specific data or authorization.
