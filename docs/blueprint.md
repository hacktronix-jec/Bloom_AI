# **App Name**: BloomWatch AI

## Core Features:

- Data Acquisition & Processing: Integrate and process NASA Earth observation data (MODIS, Landsat, SMAP, MERRA-2) in real-time for vegetation indices, soil moisture, and climate patterns.
- Bloom Detection & Monitoring: Apply AI models to detect and monitor plant blooming events globally.
- Bloom Prediction: Use AI to predict future bloom events based on historical data and current conditions, presenting results in an intuitive way. Use satellite and climate model datasets to support AI prediction capabilities.
- Interactive Map: Display bloom hotspots, trends, and forecasts on an interactive map, and incorporate tools for users to examine location-specific historical information.
- Citizen Science Layer: Implement a layer for citizen scientists to report and validate bloom events on the map.
- Dark/Light Mode: Include a switch for toggling between dark and light mode, allowing users to select their desired contrast.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#3F704F) to evoke growth and nature.
